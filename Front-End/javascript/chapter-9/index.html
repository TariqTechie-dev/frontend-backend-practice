    <h2>Creation & Development</h2>

    <div id="description">
      In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and
      head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the
      idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
      and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As
      part of the Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get
      out of his system" what he was missing in comic books. In this
      autobiography, a 1960s and non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the
      Spider as a reference, and in a multitude of print and video interviews,
      Lee claims he was further inspired by seeing a spider climb up a
      wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he
      has become unsure of whether or not this is true.
